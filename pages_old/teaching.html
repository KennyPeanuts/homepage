<h3> General Ecology BIOL 341 </h3>
<h4>General Description</h4>
Ecology is the study of how organisms interact with each other and the non&ndash;living world around them.  This simple definition encompassed an enormous amount of complexity.  Ecological topics span seemingly diverse subjects,  such as the behavior of individual organisms in their environment and the flow of energy in the biosphere.  Despite the fact that these phenomena occur on vastly different spatial and temporal scales, they are linked through ecological systems. Understanding ecology requires understanding both individual processes and their connections in the biosphere.
</p>
<p>
Investigating systems as complex as ecological systems necessitates a diverse set of scientific tools and approaches.  In this course we will focus on the process of addressing ecological questions.  You learn a foundation of ecological knowledge based on a subset of current topics but more importantly you will learn the methods that ecologists use to gain knowledge about the natural world and its complexity.  These methods include, conceptual and mathematical models, technical reading comprehension, and data synthesis.
</p>

<h4>Catalog Description</h4>
<p>
General Ecology. The principles underlying the interrelations of groups of organisms 
with their environments, including the population, community and ecosystem levels of organization. The lab 
normally includes local field trips. Prerequisites: BIOL 121 and BIOL 122 with minimum grades of C- or 
permission of instructor. 3 lecture and one 3-hour lab periods. 4 credits. WR.

<h3>Special Topics in Biology: Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function BIOL 395</h3>
<h4>General Description</h4>
<p>
However you describe the function of the Earth's biosphere, it is clear that it is influenced by biodiversity.  Ecological function is the result of the activity of all of the organisms living within a particular ecological system.  Despite the obvious connection it has been difficult to formally develop descriptions of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function.
</p>
<p>
In this course we will explore the historical development of the field of biodiversity and ecosystem function and the current state of the science.  Furthermore, we will examine how human impacts on biodiversity may alter ecological functions that human societies depend upon.

<h3>Special Topics in Biology: Biogeochemical Cycles BIOL 395</h3>
<h4>General description</h4>
<p>
  Biogeochemistry is the study of the chemistry of the biosphere.
  Life has and extraordinary impact on the flow of material and energy
  on the Earth's surface.  Earth's surface chemistry is so
  greatly altered by the activity of living things that should similar
  patterns be observed elsewhere in the universe they would be
  interpreted as virtually unquestionable evidence for the existence
  of life.
</p>
<p>
  This course will examine how the living processes on the Earth
  interact chemically with the non&ndash;living aspects of the Earth's
  atmosphere, and surface.  We will cover both the history of life's
  impact on the Earth's chemistry and how present day life continues
  to alter the biosphere.  As part of this final discussion, we will
  discuss the unique role that human activities play in the present
  state of Earth's surface chemistry.

<h3>Environmental Science GNED 162</h3>
<h4>General Description</h4>
<p>
  Environmental science is the study of the interaction between human
  activities and environmental processes.  This course is built upon a
  set of fundamental hypotheses that will shape how we seek to
  understand this interaction. 
  <ol>
    <li>The function and interaction of environmental and human
    processes can be partially understood through scientific inquiry.</li>
    <li>The biosphere is an interconnected and closed system in which
    activities in one component invariably alter other components.</li>
    <li>Human activities are part of the biosphere, and therefore
    alter and rely on the biosphere.</li>
    <li>Human interactions with the biosphere depend on both biological and cultural needs.</li>
  </ol>
