<h3> General Ecology BIOL 341 </h3>
<h4>General Description</h4>
<p>
Ecology is the study of how organisms interact with each other and the nonâ€“living world around them. This simple definition encompassed an enormous amount of complexity. Ecological questions address seemingly diverse topics such as the behavior of individual organisms in their environment and the flow of energy in the biosphere. Despite the fact that these questions occur on vastly different spatial and temporal scales, they are linked through ecological systems, and understanding ecology requires understanding both the processes and their connections.

Developing understanding of systems as complex as ecological systems requires a diverse set of scientific tools and approaches. In this course you learn the current state of understanding of ecological systems, as well as the techniques used to address ecological questions. 
</p>

<h4>Catalog Description</h4>
<p>
General Ecology. The principles underlying the interrelations of groups of organisms 
with their environments, including the population, community and ecosystem levels of organization. The lab 
normally includes local field trips. Prerequisites: BIOL 121 and BIOL 122 with minimum grades of C- or 
permission of instructor. 3 lecture and one 3-hour lab periods. 4 credits. WR.

  <h4>human anatomy</h4>
<p>In this course we focus on the structural and functional organization of the human body. We use  primarily a regional approach to the study of anatomy and emphasize a conceptual understanding of the body as an integrated unit.  In addition we employ case frequent case studies to investigate the clinical implications of alterations to anatomy due to injury or disease.  The laboratory portion of the course is based around the dissection of a cat and other animal models.
